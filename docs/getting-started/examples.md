Voting app
----------

This is a complete example of configuring Navy. There is a sample `docker-compose.yml` file with all of the service configurations. There is also a `Navyfile.js` which configures which services should be selected by default when running `navy launch`.

Head over to the source code to follow the example and get it set up.
